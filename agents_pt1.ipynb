    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the subjects brought up in previous tutorials ('LLM-as-a-Service', 'LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)', and 'LLM tool calling')\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are LLMs, really?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are basically made to predict the most probable next word given a starting text, e.g. if we feed it \"It was a dark and\" it will likely return \"stormy\". We can then append that response to the original text and repeat the process. If you guess that the next response will be \"night\" you are probably right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, that an LLM will produce a fairy tale if prompted with \"Once upon a time\" might not come as a surprise. However, what _should_ surprise you is that a prompt like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Describe the steps needed to calculate the number of days between the births of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.\n",
    "```\n",
    "results in a response like (generated by `gemma3:27b-it-qat`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Okay, here's a breakdown of the steps to calculate the number of days between the births of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Find the Birth Dates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Steve Jobs:** February 24, 1955\n",
    "*   **Bill Gates:** October 28, 1955\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Convert Dates to a Common Format (e.g., Julian Dates or YYYY-MM-DD):**\n",
    "\n",
    "While not strictly necessary for a manual calculation, converting to a standard format makes things easier and less prone to error.  For simplicity, we'll use YYYY-MM-DD.\n",
    "*   Steve Jobs: 1955-02-24\n",
    "*   Bill Gates: 1955-10-28\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Calculate the Number of Days from January 1st of the Birth Year to Each Birthday:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Steve Jobs:**  January has 31 days. February has 28 days (1955 is not a leap year). So, the day of the year for Steve Jobs is 31 + 24 = 55.\n",
    "*   **Bill Gates:** January has 31 days, February 28, March 31, April 30, May 31, June 30, July 31, August 31, September 30. Total days until October 28 are 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+30+28 = 302.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Calculate the Difference in Days:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtract the earlier date's day of the year from the later date's day of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   302 - 55 = 247 days\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, Bill Gates was born 247 days after Steve Jobs in 1955.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Leap Years:**  If the dates span across a leap year, you need to account for the extra day (February 29th).  This method only works when both dates are within the same year.\n",
    "*   **Time Zones:** If the births occurred in different time zones, you may need to adjust the calculation to get the most accurate result. (This is unlikely to be significant in this case).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, despite the apparent intelligence displayed by the LLM, they are generally notoriuosly bad at accurately performing those steps and coming up with a correct answer. One reason is that maths and fact (and a lot of other things) are not a matter of predicting the next word (or _token_, really), but they require stringence and deliberate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools in a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents exploit the clever idea of letting an LLM devise a strategy, like above, and then use _tools_ to execute those steps. There is no formal definition of an agent, but a [commonly accepted loose definition](<https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/22/tools-in-a-loop/>) is :\n",
    "\n",
    "> Agents are models using tools in a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM starts by breaking down a task into steps required to solve it, and then repeatedly call tools to perform the step, re-planning if necessary, until the goal is reached or it can be concluded that it cannot be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reason then act\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is often referred to as _ReAct_ (Reason then Act) and is actually, as we will see, a lot simpler that it sounds. Basically it boils down to a clever system prompt, defining the rules of the game."

    "### Practical considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of model is critical, not all models work well with this approach (examples later) but a good model that is available from the portal at the time of writing is `gemma3:27b-it-qat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `it` part of the name stands for _instructable_, i.e. a model fine-tuned to follow instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the [model docs for Gemma3](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core) it looks like tool calling via special tokens is supported, but that is [**not** true for the `it`-variants](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-27b-it/discussions/8#67d440e003f62909c9747a78):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Gemma 3 is great at instructability. We did some testing with various prompts which include tool call definition and output definition and have gotten good results. That said, Gemma 3 does not come with a dedicated tool use token. We invite you to try your own styles. We didn't recommend one yet because we didn't want to bias your all experimentation and tooling. This continues to be top of mind for us though.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is actually good new for us since agent instructions and tool calling doesn't always play nice and we'll write the necessary code and prompts to handle tool invocation in a consistent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other quirks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Roles used are `user` and `model` rather than the common `user` and `assistant`. However, the Ollama API seems to translate this as needed.\n",
    "- There is no `system` role and the docs suggest putting instructions in `user` messages. It is unclear if the Ollama API handles this automatically, but using `system` appears to work."

The difference here is the next step where the response is parsed and only if an answer is present in the response it is returned to the user. If an answer is not present, a tool call is made to acquire more information and control is then passed back to the LLM.\n",
