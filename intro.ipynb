    "# LLM Agents – a Three Part Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we used Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the output of LLMs, and agents are the logical next step in making an LLM more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how ChatGPT explains agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - An AI agent is an autonomous entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts on it via actuators.\n",
    "> - It aims to achieve goals by selecting actions that maximize expected utility (reward) over time.\n",
    "> - Core idea: a loop—perceive, decide (policy), act—applied in a given environment with uncertainty.\n",
    "> - Often modeled with a policy (mapping from perceptions to actions) or a value function that guides optimal behavior.\n",
    "> - Autonomy and rationality: the agent acts consistently to optimize outcomes given its knowledge and goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a good answer, it still sounds a bit magical and in this three-part the intent is to demystify the process and show that agents are in fact really simple at the core. It is assumed that you are familiar with the privious tutorials on LLMs, Pandas, and the portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "These agent tutorials first cover the basics, then expands to work interactively with real data sets, and finally exampliplifies how to work directly with portal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Agents Demystified pt. 1][3] shows how to create a basic agent using only a small amount of plain python code and the portal's LLM-as-a-Service.\n",
    "2. [Agents Demystified pt. 2][4] expands the agent with coding capabilites and the ability to e.g. interactively analyze and visualize data sets.\n",
    "3. [Agents Demystified pt. 3][5] links the agent to portal data so you can securely and privately work with your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing the tutorials you should be well positioned to use LLM agents, regardless if you choose to develop your own agents using any of the existing frameworks or deploy agents from the leading vendors.  \n",
